## About

> **[?]**
> This is simple image of **TOR** and **socat** combined together to create local DNS proxy through TOR to CloudFlare's hidden DNS resolver\ 
> https://dns4torpnlfs2ifuz2s2yf3fc7rdmsbhm6rw75euj35pac6ap25zgqad.onion/
> 
> To use it as upstream server for other docker containers your command may look like:\
> `docker run -d --name=socat-tor --restart=always sureserver/tor-socat`
> 
> If you want to access it from your host, publish port 853 like this:\
> `docker run -d --name=socat-tor -p 853:853 --restart=always sureserver/tor-socat`
> 
> This image uses obfs4 bridges to access tor network. There is a pair of them in this image. If you want to use another ones, just do it like this:\
> `docker run -d --name=socat-tor -e bridge1="obfs4 217.182.78.247:52234 FF98116BB1530B18EDFBD0721FEF9874ADB1346A cert=tPXL+y4Wk+oFiqWdGtSAJ2BhcJBBcSD3gNn6dbgvmojNXy7DSeygNuHx4PYXvM9B+fTCPg iat-mode=0" -e bridge2="obfs4 217.182.78.247:52234 FF98116BB1530B18EDFBD0721FEF9874ADB1346A cert=tPXL+y4Wk+oFiqWdGtSAJ2BhcJBBcSD3gNn6dbgvmojNXy7DSeygNuHx4PYXvM9B+fTCPg iat-mode=0" --restart=always sureserver/tor-socat`
> with your desired bridges' strings in quotes
> 
> After that just use IP-address of your container and port 853 as DNS-over-TLS upstream resolver


### Built With

> **[?]**
> Pure bash and bash only. No strings attached.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

> **[?]**
> This scripts set is intended for usage only with ubuntu 22.04 servers. It wasn't tested on any other operating system and I doubt it could work on them, because all the commands and repositories in this script were used and tested only on this operating system 

### Installation

> **[?]**
> Describe how to install and get started with the project.

## Usage

> **[?]**
> This script usage: init.sh -[cmsxfuhprabH]
> Flags determine everything
> Install: Matrix -m, Caddy -c, Xray -x, SSH honeypot -H
> Set up: SSH -s, UFW -u, Fail2ban -f
> SSH options: Custom port -p, Disable root login -r, Disable banners verbosity -b, Disable unsafe authentication methods -a
> -h or no flags Print this help
